# February, 2024:
## Goals:
This is my first journal entry on my blog. I am currently serving notice period in my company, and I shift to Europe in April,
It seems quite surreal and strange as I do not know where will I be working in 6 months. Currently I do not have any offers and have had only one interview which I couldnt crack.
This month's goal is to add:
    1. Learning Numpy
    2. Learning Pandas
    3. Probability and Statistics for Machine Learning
