## 27th April 
I reached Croatia. I am finally in Europe for good. I was so overwhelmed in my last days of work and leaving India that it still has not sunk in.
However, the good news is after months of applying I finally have three interviews lined up. Programming test to be precise, I only get interviews if I make the first round.
Still I am really happy and excited.The interviews are as follows:
1. Amazon : I have to take the interview in a week
2. Think-cell : No end date but I plan to take it by first week of May
3. Google : I asked for more time and it is scheduled on 15th of May

There is that saying, where you know in a parallel world where all possibilities are actually real meaning I could be in Google , Amazon or think -cel
or maybe none of these. But till it happens it is real in my head. The way forward is simple , I try till I get there.

Strategy for Amazon and Google is leetcode.
For think-cell I need to sharpen C++, I am not sure which resource is the best. There is this google C++ course for now that is my goto resource.

More updates on preparation in coming days.
