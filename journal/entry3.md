## 29th April
I have solved seven questions on leetcode till now. It does feel good however my solutions are not optimal and the time taken to get to optimal solution makes the amount of time spent on each problem to be considerably higher. I feel nervous as I have to take tests soon and it seems like at this pace I will not be prepared at all in time for Amazon or Google. However, I can't despair. I started preparations now and if it is the case that I cannot be prepared in a week or two so be it. I keep solving , getting better , learning, uploading my solutions, and keep repeating.

I reached Croatia. I am finally in Europe for good. I was so overwhelmed in my last days of work and leaving India that it still has not sunk in.
However, the good news is after months of applying I finally have three interviews lined up. Programming test to be precise, I only get interviews if I make the first round.
Still I am really happy and excited.The interviews are as follows:
1. Amazon : I have to take the interview in a week
2. Think-cell : No end date but I plan to take it by first week of May
3. Google : I asked for more time and it is scheduled on 15th of May

There is that saying, where you know in a parallel world where all possibilities are actually real meaning I could be in Google , Amazon or think -cell or maybe none of these. But till it happens it is real in my head. The way forward is simple , I try till I get there.

Strategy for Amazon and Google is leetcode.
For think-cell I need to sharpen C++, I am not sure which resource is the best. There is this google C++ course for now that is my goto resource.

More updates on preparation in coming days.
