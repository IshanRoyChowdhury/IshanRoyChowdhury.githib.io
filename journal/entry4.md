I took the Amazon test today. I could solve one problem out of two, second I could have solved (I think) but would need another 30 minutes.
I do feel good that I am in a better shape and was able to solve one problem and would hope I can solve more in the Google test.
Now we wait and see if I make it to the next rounds of the Amazon screening. Next week is all about Google. However I would like to finish my think cell test. Time is limited and I am not sure if I should devote time to think cell next week or not, however they are giving me an opportunity and yes I think I will make time for them. It's few hours and also a reality check of where I stand. 
More updates to follow after think-cell test.

I have solved my first ten problems on leetcode, and the path to mastery seems far and hard. There is an overwhelming sense of fear that
I will not be ready for my interviews this month, but so be it. "Miles to go before I sleep" , we keep moving forward. 
Plan is to take the amazon and think cell test over the weekend so that I can focus the next ten days on Google interview on 15th.
