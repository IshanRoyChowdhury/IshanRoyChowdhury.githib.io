I have not journalled for quite some time as it is hard. Post Amazon rejection I sat for the "think cell" test and failed miserably. They are looking for niche C++ developers however I couldnt even understand the requirement of the question properly. I am far - far away from being a C++ expert. I love the language and am only using C++ now however I know hardly anythingcompared to the language experts. It is a reality I am aware of. I had my Google interview on 15th which I postponed. I requested for some more time. The recruiters were kind enough to accept. The interview is on 5th June. I feel fear. I do not know where will I be after 5th, till then this dream still exists however far it might in reality be.

**```Amazon rejection came today.```** 
I had only been able to solve one of the two programming questions and was actually a little hopeful to make it to more rounds. In addition there were this other sections other than programming mostly technical questions based on the role and there too I did not know anything. So yes, Google is in a week and I will stop everything else and try to finish all the problems in leetcode crashcourse for Google. I do feel a little scared, but this will not be my last interview. We keep trying till we make it. Goal is to learn and grow. Onwards, no fear or shame. When I had appeared for Amazon during my bachelors I had not been able to solve any. This time I was able to solve one out of two. There is progress. Only forward we go.

I took the Amazon test today. I could solve one problem out of two, second I could have solved (I think) but would need another 30 minutes.
I do feel good that I am in a better shape and was able to solve one problem and would hope I can solve more in the Google test.
Now we wait and see if I make it to the next rounds of the Amazon screening. Next week is all about Google. However I would like to finish my think cell test. Time is limited and I am not sure if I should devote time to think cell next week or not, however they are giving me an opportunity and yes I think I will make time for them. It's few hours and also a reality check of where I stand. 
More updates to follow after think-cell test.

## 3rd May, 2024
I have solved my first ten problems on leetcode, and the path to mastery seems far and hard. There is an overwhelming sense of fear that
I will not be ready for my interviews this month, but so be it. "Miles to go before I sleep" , we keep moving forward. 
Plan is to take the amazon and think cell test over the weekend so that I can focus the next ten days on Google interview on 15th.
