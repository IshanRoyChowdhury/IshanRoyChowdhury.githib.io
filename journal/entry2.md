# March, 2024
My last working day in my current organization is 19th April. I still do not have any offer and I am kinda apprehensive of what lies ahead but also a little excited.
I am looking forward to studying again. The idea is to study and upskill myself while applying once in Europe. Initially I had sent out a large number of applications
and mostly I was applying to Mercedes Benz AG as I had grown attached to the organization and working in Germany in Mercedes AG seemed like a dream. 
The rejections have been plenty, actually all my applications were rejected at stage one except "Munich Electrification" where I did make it to the interview rounds. 
I lacked the domain knowledge when it comes to their product and was rejected post interview round. 

It has been a humbling experience. However I cannot panic and just apply if I see an opening. From all my rejections what I realized is:
  1. Cover letter is abosultely necessary and needs to be personal. I can not just use the same format for all applications
  2. Resume needs to be tailored too before submitting each application. This is something I did not follow yet, I had a basic european resume format and I kept sharing the same to all companies.
  3. Location from where we apply matter, so currently my address is bangalore, India and contact is an Indian number. Chances are application never even gets shortlisted.

Anyhow we can only do what is in our hands. So studying should be my priority. I plan to go back to machine learning basics, in addition I bought the "The statquestIllustrated Guide to machine Learning". Looks cool.

I also wanted to start the Google C++ course, currently I have reached a stage where I am comfortable reading complex C++ code, however I lack the knowledge of libraries at disposal and am not at all Object oriented.
My programs are all very procedural and I actually lack the understanding of "object oriented" programming.
More updates later.
