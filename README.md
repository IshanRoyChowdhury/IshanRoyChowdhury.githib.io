## Motivation:
I am a Software Developer based out of Bangalore, India and have worked for over five years in Automotive Software Development, and I am now planning to transition to other software engineering roles in Europe. **```I have this crazy goal of experiencing life across the world by working in different organizations and in different countries.```** I have come face to the fact that I know very little and this is the reason why I created this page in the first place. **```The idea was to create a webpage where I document my journey in transitioning into various roles as a software developer.```** I am writing this solely from the perspective of 'the present me'.

What makes one a great software developer and how can one prepare themselves for the challenges that lies in such a career? Should I solve Leetcode problems or should I rather focus on building a portfolio in machine learning? Am I skilled enough to get in a classical Software Enginner role at a Google or Amazon or should I just stop chasing the FANG rat race and focus on a meaningful career? 

I do not have the answer to the above questions, however I do know I want to develop my skills to be able to be in the rate race.
