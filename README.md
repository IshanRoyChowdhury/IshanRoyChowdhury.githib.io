The idea was to create a webpage where I document my journey in transitioning into various roles as a software developer. 
'''I have this crazy goal of experiencing life across the world by working in different organizations and in different countries. '''
## About me:
I am a Software Developer based out of Bangalore, India and for over five and a half years in Automotive Software Development, and I am now planning to transition to other software engineer roles. I have come face to the fact that I know very little and this is the reason why I created this page in the first place.

## Goals:
1. Competitive Programming
2. Machine Learning
3. Programming Languages Expertize
