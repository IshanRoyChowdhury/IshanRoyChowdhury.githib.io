The idea was to create a webpage where I document my journey in transitioning into various roles as a software developer.
## About me:
I have been a Software Developer for over five and a half years in Automotive Software Development, and I am now planning to transition to other software engineer roles. I have come face to the fact that I know very little and this is the reason why I created this page in the first place.

## Goals:
*1. Competitive Programming*
*2. Machine Learning*
*3. Programming Languages Expertize*
